<h1 >What is Zupp?</h1>
<br>
<p>1. Zupp is a technology enabled social platform that enables users, called “Travellers”, who are driving their car or any other vehicle from point A to point B to offer rides to one or more users, called “Co-travellers”, travelling in the same direction who are willing to ride along with the “Traveller”. The term “Traveller” in the context of Zupp refers to the user who is offering seats in his or her vehicle and he or she may or may not be the actual Owner of the vehicle. The terms “Traveller” and “Co-traveller” as also used purely in the scope of a single carpool transaction in Zupp.
<br>2. The incentive for the Traveller and Co-traveller to carpool or share rides might be to commute using a sustainable and eco-friendly manner or to save on fuel cost or to cut costs on more expensive/tedious commuting options or to reduce traffic on the roads or to reduce/avoid driving stress.

<br>
<h1>How do I use Zupp?</h1>
<br>
<p>Zupp allows registered users to opt to be a “Traveller” and offer rides during inter and intra-city trips or become a "Co-traveller" by searching for prospective rides on through Zupp
<br>- The "Traveller" can specify the ride details by selecting a valid starting point, ending point, route and time of departure. Other mandatory data points include Car details like number plate details, colour, AC/Non-AC, etc.
<br>- The "Co-treveller" also needs to give his/her starting point and destination for travel
<br>- Basis Zupp's patented "route-matching" algorithm, a traveller is shown options of co-travellers travelling on the same route and vice-versa. Prospective travellers will be shown to a co-traveller basis his/her route match with the other user -displayed in terms of percentage of match (Higher the route match, higher the ranking)
<br>- Zupp also prioritizes search results basis ratings of every user (which is based on the feedback of experience provided by other fellow users who have carpooled with this user before). Ratings used to determine rankings is purely based on Zupp algorithm which takes into account previous user feedback, route matching percentage, and also few other details. Zupp in no manner is liable in case of any user discomfort caused due to our rating system. Users are free to choose and avail carpool with other users of any rating.
<br>- Once a traveller or a co-traveller selects a particular user to carpool with, he/she sends a confirmation to the other user. When the other user also confirms (shows willingness) to carpool with the first user (through the application) only then does the Zupp app send phone numbers of both users to the other user. Once the phone numbers are availed of to the users, the users are expected to contact each other and confirm the carpooling details such as pick-up and drop points.
<br>- Basis the route match and the length of the route, Zupp also suggests a measure of how much saving/contribution the traveller would need to make if the carpool were to happen (In INR). If and only if the co-traveller is willing to pay the amount mentioned, to the traveller, should the co-traveller agree to carpool with the traveller through the confirm option.
<br>- The benefits accrued by the traveller are retained only by the traveller, in order for him/her to cut down on his cost of hosting the ride. The traveller does not owe any percentage of this amount to the Zupp app. Zupp is merely a platform connecting different users basis their travelling requirements.
<br>- Zupp also allows users to invite their friends for using the app, completely free of charge.
<br>- All users can see a history of their rides in the application panel and provide genuine feedback on their ride experiences through Zupp. These feedbacks and ratings would be visible to other users subsequently.<b id="4"></b>
<br>- Users agree and accept that all of the information provided to Zupp while setting up their user accounts and at any other time shall be true, correct, complete and accurate in all respects. Members also agree that any information supplied to Zupp or posted on the Site in connection with any Trip, Vehicle or Car Sharing will be true, accurate and complete.
