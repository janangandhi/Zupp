<br>
<h1  >What data does Zupp ask for? And who can view this data?</h1>
<br>
 <p id="z1">A user needs to register on Zupp, through Zupp Android Application, in order to use our services
<br>1. You need register on Zupp with your facebook account. This step is mandatory to use Zupp. Basic details (if available on your public profile) such as your profile picture, Company name, mobile number, age and gender would be extracted through an automated process from your facebook profile. This data will be visible to other users prior to carpool.
<br>2. To authenticate your mobile number an automated code would be sent as an sms. Users need to feed in this code to complete mobile number authentication. This data will be visible to a user who confirm to carpool with you and in-turn you confirm to carpool with him/her.
<BR>3. You may also provide your company email ID in order to complete your profile. An automated mail will be sent to your official email to complete registration. This step is not mandatory, however other users will be able to know if this process has been completed from your end. Zupp also uses official email ID to match users of same company. Other users cannot view your email ID, but only your company name.
<BR>4. Travellers who wish to host rides, also need to input car details such as car colour, AC/Non AC, car number plate details, etc, which would be visible to other co-travellers looking for rides.
<BR>5. As a part of creating a secure and safe community, users are also asked to upload approved government identity proofs (including, but not limited to PAN card, Driving license and Aadhar card). Zupp only validates that the name on the facebook profile provided and the name on the ID provided, match. Zupp does not take the responsibility to ensure authenticity of the documents uploaded. This step is not mandatory, however other users would be able to view whether this step has been completed or not. Other users cannot view the document uploaded by you for the authentication purpose.
<BR>6. All users (traveller/co-traveller) need to input basic details such as Starting point, Ending point and time of departure into the Zupp application. Once a carpool is completed, all users can see their individual ride history.
<BR>7. Zupp also asks all users to provide a genuine feedback and rate their ride experience. The rating that you provide to others will be stored in our database and users can see the rating that others have provided for them.
